    <h1>Argentinian Empanada Filling </h1>

    <img src="../images/IMG_0531.jpeg" alt="">

<p>There are as many variations of empanada as there are cooks in Argentina (though 
    they’re popular throughout Latin America and Spain too). I developed this version 
    while staying in El Salvador during covid-19 as a creative way to spend my time 
    and eat good food. This recipe really stands out for the simple farm theme by 
    including ingredients you are likely to have on hand in a well stocked rustic 
    kitchen. Also, to keep things simple and tasty I purposely didn’t include the 
    usuals like eggs or olives because I feel it’s way to many textures. This beef 
    and potatoes recipe shines in a rich smokey sauce with a mustard kick, 
    giving this recipe a deeper flavor profile.

        <li> ½ cup chopped chives preferred (or scallions, green parts only)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
-> Preferably salt and marinate your beef on a wire mesh to drain the liquids for 10 days (yes, 10 days
 in the fridge will give the meat such an amazing texture and the meat will be fine). <- 
 <li> Bowl 1-  Season beef generously with salt and pepper and set aside for minimum 10
 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons fat mix well, rest for 10 minutes. Heat a large heavy skillet
  over medium heat. Add beef and sear until meet begins to sweat heavy 10m. Raise heat to high 
  and sear so moisture can evaporate, stirring throughout to keep pieces separate, about 
  15 minutes. Lower to heat to medium high for Browning</li>

<br>
<li>Bowl 2- Add lightly caramelized onion and continue searing, about 1 minutes. Add fat if 
necessary so food doesn't burn. Lower heat to medium for 2m</li>
<br>
<li>Bowl 3- Add potatoes, garlic, thyme and marjoram and stir well to incorporate. (Add a little 
more fat to pan if mixture seems dry.) Season again with salt and pepper and let mixture fry 
for 1-2 more minutes. </li>
<br>
<li>Bowl 4- Stir in tomato paste, smoked paprika, cayenne, wine and a cup of broth or two, or water. 
Turn heat to simmer, stirring well to incorporate any caramelized bits. Cook for about 10 more
 minutes, until both meat and potatoes are tender and the sauce coats them — juicy, not saucy 
 is what you want. Taste and adjust seasoning for full flavor (intensity will diminish upon 
 cooling). </li>
 <br>
 <li>Bowl 5- Remove pan from heat and stir in chives, let cool to room temperature. Cover and 
refrigerate or freeze immediately until ready to use.</li>
</ol>
