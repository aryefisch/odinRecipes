    <p>
      It's time for the cheese tax people! Move over fried mozzarella
      sticks...there's a new treat in town. Soft, crunchy, gooey hotness, fried
      in butter oil and hot of the rack.
      <br>
      <br>
      Come hungry, leave happy; that's the slogan for my Three Cheese Empanada.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is the third recipe I developed for the empanada catering in El
      Salvador during the covid-19 pandemic of 2020. Many northern European
      people who are traditionaly rabbit eaters need to consume high amounts of
      zinc through their diet, which is why they eat rabbit, an animal rich in
      zinc. They (I) cannot eat mazzarella- a cheese that depletes zinc-. So I developed
      an alternative. And you know what?! It's even better than mazzarella. It's
      gluten free. So what are you eating tonight?
